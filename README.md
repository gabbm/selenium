Here you can find the steps to install and run successfully a selenium server into a Debian distribution.

1- Install Java JDK 1.7 and make it the default java instruction (install/install_jdk7.sh)
2- Install firefox (install/install_firefox.sh)
3- Install selenium (install/install_selenium.sh)

After the installation you could execute the Selenium tests created with Selenium IDE or handful written. 

You must use the JUnit 4 libraries for the Selenium tests.

You can find an example into tests folder:
* TestSelenium.java -> Selenium test
* TestSeleniumRunner -> Main class to run the TestSelenium class

to run them you should execute:
* Compile Java classes:
	```java
	javac -classpath ".:/opt/selenium/selenium-java-2.53.1/selenium-2.53.1/*:/opt/selenium/selenium-java-2.53.1/selenium-2.53.1/libs/*" TestSeleniumRunner.java
	```
	
	```java
	javac -classpath ".:/opt/selenium/selenium-java-2.53.1/selenium-2.53.1/*:/opt/selenium/selenium-java-2.53.1/selenium-2.53.1/libs/*" TestSelenium.java
	```
	
* Execute Java classes:
	```java
	java -cp ".:/opt/selenium/selenium-java-2.53.1/selenium-2.53.1/*:/opt/selenium/selenium-java-2.53.1/selenium-2.53.1/libs/*" TestSeleniumRunner
	```

You would obtain an output like this:
```

the last two lines are System.out from TestSeleniumRunner. If there had been errors, it would have shown you which kind of problem it would have been.

IMPORTANT!!!
Some times the variable DISPLAY is not configured on Linux, due to this reason firefox can't launch and the tests will fail.

To solve this, you should export the DISPLAY 0:
	```
	export DISPLAY=:0
	```
